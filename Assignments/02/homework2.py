    7.  write code that reads in file 'test_file2.txt', creates a separate file for each geographic region 
        the animals are from, and prints only the animals from that region to the file, one animal per line.
        for example, you should create the file 'africa.txt', and that file should have:
        
        elephant
        lion
        giraffe
        zebra
        hyena
        
        also, the program cannot "hard code" the names of the files. You need to figure out the names of the output 
        files from the input files. For example, if I test your code on a new input file that has animals from china, or
        antarctica, or Wonderland, the program should still work!

        6.) prints out the document, one letter at a time, with each word on a different line and each letter separated
                by a space. For example, the first three lines should be:
