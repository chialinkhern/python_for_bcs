"""
    The code below is a complex program that reads in files of music lyrics, and counts the number of words for each
    artist, giving each song a 'complexity score' consisting of the number unique words divided by the number of total
    words. Songs that are more repetitive (i.e. a lower ratio of unique words to total words) will get a low score.

    Examine the code below. Start by going to the bottom and finding the main function. Try to Follow the
    code by going through it in the order it will be executed.

    Comment the code to show that you understand what each function is doing. For each function, create a multiline
    'docstring' comment at the beginning of each function. A docstring is a special kind of comment that other programs
    understand as a description of how a function works (like those that can be used to generate documentation webpages
    for your program). For each function, make a docstring that looks like what is shown in the next triple-quoted
    section:
"""

"""
    A description of the function goes first. Describe in general what it does and how it works. Then after the
    general description, you will list the parameters and return values below. If a function does not take input 
    parameters or return a value, then you can omit those lines from the docstring
    
    :param param1_name: this is a description of the first parameter, including its data type
    :param param2_name: this is a description of the second parameter, including its data type
    :returns: this is a description of what is returned, including its data type
"""

"""
    After you have made docstrings for each function, add the functions that accomplish the following things:
    - checks to make sure the program's input argument (the directory passed to the program when it is run)
        - exists, and quits and prints an error message if not
        - has directories in it
    - checks to make sure that each artist directory has files in it, and quits and prints a message if not
    - checks to make sure that each song lyric file has at least one word in it, and prints a warning message if not
    - lower-cases each token
    - removes punctuation characters from the end of each token
    - dont forget to create docstrings for your new functions as well!

    When writing this, keep in mind that that some of these objectives might reasonably be broken into multiple
    functions, to keep the code as tidy as possible.

    Also keep in mind where you call those functions from. For example, there are many places you could reasonably
    call a "remove_punctuation" function. But where is the "best" place to call it?
