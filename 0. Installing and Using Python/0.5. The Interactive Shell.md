So far when we have run python programs, you have typed python followed by a file name. You can, however, just type python in the terminal without a file name, and this will open what is referred to as the "interactive shell".

Note that the prompt has changed from something involving your computer name, user name, and path, to just three arrows >>>. If you see the three arrows, you know you are in the interactive shell. In the interactive shell, you can type and execute python commands one at a time.

The interactive shell can be a very useful and quick way to try out a line or a couple of lines of code, to see if it works or to remind yourself how to do something.

When you are ready to exit the interactive shell and return back to the regular Terminal prompt, just type "exit()" or CTRL-D.
